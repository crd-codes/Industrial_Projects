# File Packer & Unpacker with Encryption

## 🛠 Technology : Java Programming

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Java-based file utility tool** that provides functionality for packing multiple files into a single archive and unpacking them back with all metadata preserved.  
To enhance security, the packed file is **encrypted**, and only authorized users can decrypt and extract the data.  

---

## ✨ Features

### File Packing
- Combines multiple regular files into a single archive file.
- Stores metadata (file name, size) along with file content.

### File Unpacking
- Extracts individual files from the packed archive.
- Restores all original metadata and file structure.

### Data Security
- Built-in encryption and decryption to protect packed files.
- Uses XOR-based encryption in Java.
